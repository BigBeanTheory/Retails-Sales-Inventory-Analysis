**Project Type**: End-to-End Data Analytics / Business Intelligence  
**Tech Stack**: Python (pandas, mysql-connector-python), MySQL, Power BI Desktop  
**Dataset**: ~73,000 rows from Kaggle Retail Store Inventory Forecasting Dataset  
**Time Period**: Daily sales & inventory records spanning multiple years

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Build a complete analytics system to help retail businesses understand sales performance, detect inventory risks (stockouts & overstock), uncover seasonal patterns, and support data-driven inventory & merchandising decisions.

---

## 💼 Business Problem Addressed

Retailers frequently face two costly problems:

- **Stockouts**: Lost sales when inventory is too low during high-demand periods
- **Overstock**: Tied-up capital, storage costs, and obsolescence when inventory is too high

### Solution Approach

This project creates a scalable, automated analytics pipeline and dashboard to:

✅ Monitor real-time sales & inventory health  
✅ Flag high-risk products early  
✅ Visualize trends and seasonality to inform buying & promotion strategies  
✅ Enable data-driven decision-making for inventory management

```

### 1. **Data Ingestion & ETL** 📥

- **Source**: Raw CSV (~73,000 rows) containing:
  - Date, Store ID, Product ID, Category, Region
  - Units Sold, Inventory Level, Price, Discount
  - Weather Condition, Holidays, Competitor Pricing, etc.

- **Python Script** (`scripts/retail_pipeline.py`):
  - Loads CSV using pandas
  - Handles data types, missing values, date parsing
  - Performs basic cleaning & feature engineering
  - Inserts records into MySQL in batches (5,000 rows/batch) for efficiency

### 2. **Database Layer (MySQL)** 🗄️

- **Schema**: Normalized tables designed for analytics
  - `sales_transactions`: Core sales and inventory data
  - `inventory_risk_metrics`: Calculated risk indicators
  - `generated_demand_forecasts`: Future demand predictions (extensible)

- **Automated SQL Scripts**:
  - `initial.sql`: Creates database schema and tables
  - `risk_metrics.sql`: Calculates:
    - Turnover rate (units sold / inventory)
    - Stockout risk flags (low inventory + high recent sales)
    - Overstock risk flags (high inventory + low sales)
    - Risk level categorization (Normal / High Stockout Risk / High Overstock Risk)

### 3. **Risk Scoring Logic** 🚨

Custom thresholds (tunable based on business requirements):

| Risk Type | Condition | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Stockout Risk** | Low inventory + High sales | Inventory ≤ 40 AND Units Sold ≥ 25 |
| **Overstock Risk** | High inventory + Low sales | Inventory ≥ 350 AND Units Sold ≤ 8 |

**Results**: 521 products flagged across the dataset (primarily overstock in certain categories)

### 4. **Power BI Dashboard** 📈

Interactive 3-page dashboard providing comprehensive retail analytics. See the [Dashboard Screenshots](#-dashboard-screenshots) section below for detailed visualizations.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** with pip
- **MySQL Server 8.0+**
- **Power BI Desktop** (for viewing dashboard)
- **Dataset**: Included in repository (`retail_store_inventory.csv`) or download from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/retail-sales-analytics.git
   cd retail-sales-analytics
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas mysql-connector-python
   ```

3. **Set up MySQL Database**
   - Start your MySQL server
   - Run the schema creation script:
     ```bash
     mysql -u root -p < initial.sql
     ```

4. **⚠️ Configure Database Credentials**
   
   **IMPORTANT**: Before running `retail_pipeline.py`, you must manually set your database credentials:
   
   Open `scripts/retail_pipeline.py` and update lines 9-11:
   ```python
   conn = mysql.connector.connect(
       host="localhost",        # Set your MySQL host (e.g., "localhost")
       user="your_username",    # Set your MySQL username (e.g., "root")
       password="your_password", # Set your MySQL password
       database="retail_db",
       raise_on_warnings=True
   )
   ```

5. **Prepare the Dataset**
   - The project includes `retail_store_inventory.csv` (5.9 MB, ~73,000 rows)
   - Alternatively, download fresh data from Kaggle
   - Update the CSV path in `scripts/retail_pipeline.py` (line 110) if needed:
     ```python
     csv_path = r"e:\Work\Retail Sales Project\retail_store_inventory.csv"
     ```

### Running the Pipeline

1. **Execute the ETL script**
   ```bash
   python scripts/retail_pipeline.py
   ```
   This will:
   - Load and clean the CSV data
   - Insert ~73,000 rows into MySQL
   - Display progress in batches

2. **Calculate Risk Metrics**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p retail_db < risk_metrics.sql
   ```

3. **Open Power BI Dashboard**
   - Launch Power BI Desktop
   - Open `Retail Dashboard.pbix`
   - When prompted, update the data source connection:
     - **Server**: localhost (or your MySQL host)
     - **Database**: retail_db
     - **Username/Password**: (your MySQL credentials)
   - Click **"Refresh"** to load data from MySQL
